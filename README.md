# Env config files

This repo contains my tmux and nvim configuration. A lot of the content here
is inspired by the configs from [ThePrimeagen](https://github.com/ThePrimeagen/.dotfiles) and [josean-dev](https://github.com/josean-dev/dev-environment-files) (thank you!)

## How to use these files

This repo is meant to be cloned into your home directory, and from there you
should be able to symlink the files to their relevant directories.

If you see anything bad in here, do me a solid and open a PR ðŸ˜„

## Misc notes

Some of the extensions assume patched fonts which allow for icons to be rendered as glyphs - are installed. These can be downloaded from [Nerd Fonts](https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads)

## [Update 2024-08-20]

I thought I'd try out LazyVim + Zellij. I quickly reverted Zellij, but giving LazyVim a real chance. My "manual" `nvim` config is in the `nvim_bak` folder for now.
